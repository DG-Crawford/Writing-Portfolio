										<h2>Context</h2>
                                        <p>Provided search engine optimization (SEO) research, keyword research, copywriting, and editing to various clients.</p>
                                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                                        <p>One major client I worked with had no website at all. Searching for his business on Google didn't even show results! He reached out to me because he knew it would be essential for business to not only show up in Google searches, but to rank well.</p>
                                        <h2>Contribution</h2>
                                        <p>I researched my cleint's competitors, generated keywords and anaylzed their ranking, difficulty, and volume, and drafted pages using the aforementioned research that would later form into a full, concise website.
											Over the year, I worked off and on because SEO changes daily and I needed to make sure previous keywords did not immediately drop in effectiveness. By the end, I published:
											<ul>
												<li>One landing page</li>
												<li>One about and one contact page</li>
												<li>Ten+ service pages, from specific products to long-term maintenance services</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<p><img src=images\desert-springs.jpg width="951.5" height="401"></p>
                                        <h2>Impact</h2>
                                        <p>											
											<ul>
												<li>Potential clients and cusomters were able to find his business when searching for products similar to what his business offered.</li>
												<li>Helped boost his company's search engine ranking to the second page, doubling organic leads from website traffic.</li>
												<li>Helped increase web traffic and leads by roughly 200% during the months I worked with the client.</li>
											</ul>
