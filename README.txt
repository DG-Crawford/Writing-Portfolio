As a writer and editor, I have researched, written, and published pieces on various topics such as a pharmaceutical discovery, research on sleep cycles, and strategies for managing a tax audit.

I possess expertise in drafting, editing, and publishing long- and short-form writing for print and digital publications, a marketing company, and a medical organization. In my current role at VillageMD, I author and maintain job aids for various departments, including the call center, referral team, legal department, and more

I enjoy brainstorming out-of-the-box solutions to problems and creating practical tools and documentation for coworkers and clients. Furthermore, I possess some knowledge of valuable skills, content management systems, and programs such as HTML, GitHub, Confluence, SharePoint, and Microsoft Office.
